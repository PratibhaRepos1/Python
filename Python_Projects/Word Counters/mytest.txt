Tapase said he will meet Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on 

Tuesday on the issue and seek clarification from Union Home Minister Amit 
Shah on the chatgate.

The question also arises how Arnab was privy to such sensitive information. 
The Ministry of Home Affairs has to identify the source and immediately take action,
 he said.

Goswami has been at the forefront in maligning the image of the Mumbai police and also the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state, Tapase claimed.
