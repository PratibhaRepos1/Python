The Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Monday asked the government to
set up a Joint Parliamentary Committee to probe the purported chats between Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab
Goswami and former Broadcast Audience Research Council head Partho Dasgupta.

Referring to the purported chats widely reported in media which mentioned that Goswami
was privy to the Balakot airstrikes, NCP chief spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said
It is extremely shocking and disturbing to know how issues related to national security have been used to gain TRPs.
